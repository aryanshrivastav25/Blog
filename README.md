#### Description:
It is a blogging site where users can add their blogs, edit them or delete them. They can also see other users' blogs.

They can also search specific blogs and also change their passwords. It requires the user to first register in the database and then login to their account.

In this project, I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript for Frontend and Python and Flask Framework for backend.

Users can also search other blogs specifically by typing in the search box.
